# USELECTION2016
# This R code is inspired by Julia Silge, so THANK YOU!
# Mike Kearney has gathered county-level election results and first put it on GitHub, so THANK YOU!
# The R code can generate Choropleth visualization for desired states using 2016 election data.
# The R code is for California, Maryland and Virginia but you can look up the FIPS code and generate the Choropleth for the states you are interested.
